# Clock From Scratch

Clock From Scratch is a simple web app that gives you the time of day.
I wrote this project to learn more about web development tools.
This project uses the following tools:
- NPM for package management
- Webpack for bundling
- Jest for testing
- ESLint for linting
- Babel for javascript compatibility
- Autoprefixer for CSS compatibility
